# Very Hungry Caterpillar

The very hungry caterpillar is a book for children written and illustrated by Eric Carle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar)
This program is inspired by it. I bought the pop-up version.

## Current status

This program is intended to write (more or less) the tale on Console, but it's poorly written. It compiles, but sadly it doesn't work. Maybe you can fix it ;-)

## Goals

This program can be improved in several ways

- Object oriented
- Decouple behavior from state
- Decouple tracing system implementation

And it can be used to play with and show off your skills with SOLID principles.
